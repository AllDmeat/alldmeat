### Hey, I'm Aleksey Berezka

I’m an iOS Tech Lead at Dodo Engineering with nearly 15 years of software development experience.  
Started coding back in the days of iOS 4 and Objective-C, now fully immersed in Swift, UIKit, and SwiftUI.

Expert in building scalable, reliable iOS apps with a strong focus on architecture, CI/CD automation, and long-term technical leadership.

I enjoy solving complex problems, leading teams through change, and keeping projects on the cutting edge.

### About my work at Dodo

I lead the technical development of the Dodo Pizza iOS app — focusing on performance, maintainability, and smooth evolution of the platform.  
I drive platform-wide technical projects: migrating from UIKit to SwiftUI, upgrading Swift versions, and scaling the app across 25+ countries and languages.

I'm also deeply involved in CI/CD infrastructure.  
I design and maintain automated pipelines for testing, linting, code review, release distribution, and monitoring — helping the team ship confidently and move fast without breaking things.

As a tech lead, I also mentor developers:  
I help onboard new teammates, teach architecture and testing practices, and regularly share the latest tools, patterns, and iOS ecosystem updates.

I joined Dodo in 2019, started with features and UI work, and grew into a leadership role where I write technical strategies, lead cross-team initiatives, and keep engineering quality high at scale.

### Side project: Slynk

I built **Slynk** to solve a small but real pain: transferring people from **Slack** to iPhone **Contacts** with less friction.  
The app adds teammates to your contacts in one tap — no more copy-pasting.

It transfers:
• name, phone, email, birthday, photo, and organization  
• fills in missing data for existing contacts  
• works fast, looks clean, and just does the job
